# Privacy

By default, StrikeDistance does not collect any personal information. If you choose to share your approximate location with the app to request local weather conditions, it will be shared with [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org), a third-party weather service. OpenWeatherMap does not store the location coordinates sent by StrikeDistance. You may view their full privacy policy [here](https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy#important_information).
